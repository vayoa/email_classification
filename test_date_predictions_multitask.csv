"Subject: We're Updating our Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy

Hello,
We're writing to inform you about important updates to our Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy. These changes will take effect on September 28, 2025, or you can choose to accept the updated terms before this date when you log in to Claude.ai. 
These changes only affect Consumer accounts (Claude Free, Pro, and Max plans). If you use Claude for Work, via the API, or other services under our Commercial Terms or other Agreements, then these changes don't apply to you. 
What's changing?
1. Help improve Claude by allowing us to use your chats and coding sessions to improve our models
    With your permission, we will use your chats and coding sessions to train and improve our AI models. If you accept the updated Consumer Terms before September 28, your preference takes effect immediately. 
    If you choose to allow us to use your data for model training, it helps us:
        Improve our AI models and make Claude more helpful and accurate for everyone
        Develop more robust safeguards to help prevent misuse of Claude
    We will only use chats and coding sessions you initiate or resume after you give permission. You can change your preference anytime in your Privacy Settings.
2. Updates to data retention– your choices and controls
    If you choose to allow us to use your data for model training, we’ll retain this data for 5 years. This enables us to improve Claude through deeper model training as described above, while strengthening our safety systems over time. You retain full control over how we use your data: if you change your training preference, delete individual chats, or delete your account, we'll exclude your data from future model training. Learn more about our data retention practices here.
